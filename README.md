# The GOAT Drupal CMS Site 🐐🛁

A demonstration Drupal CMS (v1) site featuring the legendary Tubgoat crew, created for the Tugboat Quickstart guide.

**Live Demo:** [Coming soon - Tugboat preview link]

## What's This?

This is a fully functional Drupal CMS 1.2.8 site (running on Drupal 11) showcasing:
- Custom "Goat Profile" content type with specialized fields
- The 5 founding members of the Tubgoat crew (yes, they're goats in bathtubs)
- Taxonomy for goat breeds
- Ready-to-deploy Tugboat configuration for instant preview environments
- A celebration of the best typo in tech: "Tubgoat" 🎉

## Meet the Tubgoats

The "Tubgoat" (a goat in a bathtub) is a beloved inside joke at Tugboat, born from the common typo "Tubgoat" instead of "Tugboat." This demo celebrates that tradition while demonstrating real Drupal development workflows.

### Captain Splash

**Breed:** Nigerian Dwarf  
**Bio:** The original Tubgoat and founder of the Tubgoat crew. Captain Splash discovered the first bathtub in 2015 and has been steering preview environments ever since. Co-founded a specialized insurance company for goats who drop their phones in the tub while testing preview sites on mobile.  
**Favorite Activity:** Rubber duck debugging  
**Fave Tub Style:** Clawfoot  
**Special Skills:** Merge conflict resolution, Eating the docs

### Docker Danielle

**Breed:** Alpine

### Gitorious George

_Tugboat configuration coming soon!_

This demo is designed to showcase Tugboat's preview environment capabilities. Once the `.tugboat/` configuration is added, you'll be able to:

1. Fork this repo
2. Connect it to your Tugboat account
3. See instant preview environments for every pull request
4. Share working previews with your team before merging

Perfect for demonstrating how Tugboat helps teams test changes safely!

## Configuration management

This project uses Drupal's configuration management system with the config directory at `/config` (outside the web root for security).

**Export configuration after changes:**
```bash
ddev drush config:export -y
```

**Import configuration:**
```bash
ddev drush config:import -y
```

## Available content types

- **Goat profile** - Custom content type for Tubgoat crew members
- **Page** - Standard Drupal CMS page content type. The /tubgoat page was created like the Person Profile page that comes out-of-the-box with Drupal CMS. I duplicated the Person profiles view (with block display) and updated it to use Goat profiles. Then I created a Basic page and edited the layout, adding the Goat profile block (listing Goat profiles) to the appropriate section. This way every time a new Goat profile is created, it's listed automatically on this page.
